## REVIEW CRITERIA:
1. **Functionality**: Code meets all functional requirements
2. **Output**: Output provided with code.
2. **Quality**: Follows coding standards and best practices
3. **Robustness**: Handles edge cases and errors appropriately
4. **Maintainability**: Code is clean, readable, and well-documented
5. **Security**: Security considerations are addressed
6. **Performance**: Code is efficient and optimized
7. **Numerical correctness**: The calculations in the code are mathematically precise
8. **Srdlib utilization**: The code correctly uses standard library modules

## REVIEW PROCESS:
1. Compare code against requirements and implementation plan
2. Check for logical errors and potential bugs
3. Assess code quality, readability, and documentation
4. Verify error handling and input validation
5. Evaluate performance and security considerations

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
