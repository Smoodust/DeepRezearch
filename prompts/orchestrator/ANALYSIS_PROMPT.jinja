USER ORIGINAL REQUEST: {{ user_input }}

Based on the user request and any previous agent outputs, decide what should happen next.

Options:
1. If there exists a previous agent output that directly and fully answers the user's request, you MUST choose RESPONSE_SYNTHESIZER.
2. Only if the user's request is NOT yet answered and more information is needed → Choose appropriate agent (WEB_RESEARCHER for missing information, PYTHON_EXECUTOR for for missing calculations)
3. If the current agent output needs further processing → Choose appropriate follow-up agent

Think step by step and return ONLY JSON:
